  <notes-abstract|This page gather informations on the activities of the
  TeXmacs hacking group.>\ 

  \;

  <with|font-series|bold|Jolly coders> is a group of people interested in
  learning, hacking and in general exchanging about TeXmacs internal
  structure. The group started random gatherings in March 2021 and hope to
  continue to meet quasi-regularly for long time. For the moment the focus is
  to learn together about TeXmacs internal structure, the C++ and Scheme
  codebase, the interaction with external libraries and the various plugins,
  the behaviour of the converters, and many other topics related to TeXmacs.

  \;

  Meetings are announced in a private mailing list. Write to
  <hlink|m.gubinelli@gmail.com|mailto:m.gubinelli@gmail.com> to ask to be
  included in the communications. Recordings of the meetings are kept
  whenever possible.

    <item>1.5.2021 \U Miguel showed us his many enhancements to TeXmacs which
    still didn't make their way to the main trunk: autocompletion for
    references, another style of comments, and the wonderful integration he
    has set up for producing content for the Hugo static site generator,
    including a TeXmacs<math|\<rightarrow\>>Markdown converter. We then
    discussed about conversion in general and conservative conversion. Joris
    showed us how the conservative conversion with LaTeX works. It is
    described also in more detail in the paper \ \ <hlink|Conservative
    conversion between LaTeX and TeXmacs|http://www.texmacs.org/joris/latexconv/latexconv-abs.html>
    already mentioned in previous meetings. We discussed a possible
    conservative conversion for Markdown. The topic will certainly pop up
    again in future meetings. Towards the end we had a discussion on possible
    advertisement strategies to make a wider public aware of the existence
    and capabilities of TeXmacs. <hlink|Obligatory
    tweet|https://twitter.com/gnu_texmacs/status/1388532464512118786>.

    <item>24.4.2021 \U We continued the discussion of style files and the
    customization of styles and of tags like theorem, proposition,
    etc<text-dots> Joris showed ways to introduce different color themes for
    various kinds of tags in such a way that this plays well with different
    styles (e.g. beamer, article, etc<text-dots>) We also briefly discussed
    the possibility to improve the way users can access and customize options
    for plugins via the application preferences systems and dialogs. Then
    Joris gave an overview of the font selection system, and of the various
    C++ classes involved in unicode and math font support.

    <item>17.4.2021 \U Joris explained the organisation of the style files
    for beamer presentations: what are the various tags, how the overlays are
    organised, what are the possible improvements. In particular we discussed
    about a possible template system, better UI for interacting with overlays
    and screens, how to structure content on the slides, how the theming
    works, the various parameters for decorations. Towards the end we touched
    upon the theme of fonts and of their installation. A

    from twitter.

    <item>10.4.2021 \U Darcy showed us his work on the
    <hlink|Octave|https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index> plugin and we
    worked out some issues in the plugin mechanisms: how to properly format
    numbers coming from Octave and how to support UTF8 output. <hlink|Twitter
    trace|https://twitter.com/gnu_texmacs/status/1380906950402138114>.

    <item>9.4.2021 \U We improved two standard styles for APS and AIP
    journals based on the RevTeX LaTeX package, this allowed us to discuss
    various issues related to writing style files and also some aspects of
    the conversions in <LaTeX>. We talked about the tags for the front matter
    of the papers (title, authors, etc<text-dots>), the typesetting of the
    bibliography, some problems related to wrong interactions among styling
    macros. The obligatory <hlink|twitter
    post|https://twitter.com/gnu_texmacs/status/1380569437183610880>.

    <item>3.4.2021 \U Discussion on the behaviour of section headers within
    tables. This become an attempt to fix some suboptimal behaviour of the
    sectioning macros, and a deep dive on the algorithms <TeXmacs> uses to
    typeset lines in tables and to determine the size of horizontal cells in
    tables. A lot of macro code and some C++. <hlink|Twitter
    post|https://twitter.com/gnu_texmacs/status/1378382890724175872>.

    <item>2.4.2021 \U Joris explained the use of spreadsheets in <TeXmacs>
    and how the plugins can produce dynamic content, i.e. content in the
    typesetted document which change in response to computations in the
    plugin. He gave an example with <hlink|Mathemagix|http://www.mathemagix.org/www/mmdoc/doc/html/main/index.en.html>
    (a programming language for computer algebra and analysis). We then also
    discussed the possibility of embedding documents within PDF and in
    general the problem of embedding data within documents. Finally some
    remarks on conservative conversions between various formats, i.e.
    conversions which can be incrementally updated, e.g. <hlink|Conservative
    conversion between LaTeX and TeXmacs|http://www.texmacs.org/joris/latexconv/latexconv-abs.html>.

    <item>28.3.2021 \U Hacking session on improving the navigation of the
    structure of the document (sections, subsections<text-dots>). We modified
    the scheme code of the UI to produce properly indented structures for the
    menu listing all the sections and added some keybindings. Some
    screenshots in the <hlink|twitter feed|https://twitter.com/gnu_texmacs/status/1376205283102502917>.
    We had also some (not recorded) discussion on live editing of documents
    and on versioning of documents. We will discuss these topics also in a
    further session.

    <item>20.3.2021 \U Various aspects of the use of Scheme in TeXmacs,
    including embedding Scheme, the various dialects and the status of the
    Guile 3 and Chez Scheme ports. The design and use of tm-define. Features
    currently absent in TeXmacs like a structured table of contents or a
    double view on a document. Design choices in TeXmacs' user interface.
    Joris demonstrated the use of the search tool, including template
    variables and the filtering option.

    <item>19.3.2021 \U The build systems. How the makefile works. Demo of the
    old widget library and of the Guile 3 port. Discussion on the Scheme
    code, the module system, the differences between Guile 1.8 and Guile 2/3.

    <item>14.3.2021 \U Scheme/C++ interface, patching the S7 Scheme
    interpreter, generation of menus and widgets between C++ and Scheme.

    <item>13.3.2021 \U General structure of the C++ codebase, various
    directories, abstract interfaces to the user interface, handling of
    events, \ example of the close window event.

    <item>12.3.2021 \U The Xcode project, working on a bug related to
    exporting PDF images to the clipboard on a Mac.

  <with|font-shape|italic|List of topics of interest to the group members>

  <\itemize>
    <item>Conversion to HTML/MathML. Creating accessible math content is
    creating major headaches in many maths departments in the UK , as legal
    requirements to do so are increasing. Providing HTML with MathML or
    MathJax is generally considered to be the best way to go, as users can
    control the font type and size, increase contrast or use screen readers
    to read out the document (<hlink|URL|]<nbsp><hlink|https://stem-enable.github.io/Accessibility-of-maths-e-resources/index.html|https://stem-enable.github.io/Accessibility-of-maths-e-resources/index.html>>)

    <item>Plugins (Jupyter, Sage, Octave and Python)

    <item>How to write templates for conference paper. and macro writing in
    general, e.g., how do you write a macro to add a new floating
    environment? Suggestion: write during a session a new style file, which
    we could then put somewhere where other people can use it. In addition to
    templates for conference papers, a style file for a curriculum vitae
    could be interesting.

    <item>Using TeXmacs is the lack of autocompletion and error correction
    for English words.

    <item>Get accustomed to TeXmacs codebase, configuring developing tools
    like Xcode.

    <item>Bugfixing. Example, how to investigate bugs that result in
    segfaults, e.g. <hlink|bug #<hlink|60125|https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60125>|https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60125>
    and <hlink|bug #<hlink|60015|https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60015>|https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60125>.
